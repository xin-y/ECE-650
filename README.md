This project is to help the local polic department with their installation of security cameras at traffic intersections.
The key is to solve a particular kind of optimization problem, called Vertex Cover Problem, in this context. The idea is,
for the police to be able to minimize the number of cameras they need to install. and also be as effective as possible with their monitoring.
